# Products Receipts

This project was made using Ruby version 3.3.4.

To run the program, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```sh
ruby main.rb < input.txt > output.txt
```

This command will run the `main.rb` script, taking `input.txt` as the input file and directing the output to `output.txt`.

Add as many inputs as you like on the input file separated by a blank space and in the end of the file add **two blank lines**.

The result will be shown on the `output.txt` file.

# Tests

To run the tests just run `rspec`, after run a `bundle install`.
